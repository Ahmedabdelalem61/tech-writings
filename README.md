# Odoo Access Rights in a Nutshell

> **Objective:**  
> Build a simple  understanding of Odoo security in a nutshell, including access rights, record rules, and group logic. Explore hierarchical steps for mastering deeper security concepts.

---

## üì¶ Description

This section provides a comprehensive understanding of Odoo's access control mechanisms, including **access rights**, **record rules**, and how they interact. The structure builds knowledge step-by-step to explore Odoo security concepts in depth.

---

## üõ† Simple ACL (Access Control List)

**General Overview:**  
Access Control Lists (ACLs) define basic permissions like `read`, `write`, `create`, and `unlink` for specific user groups.

---

## üìú Record Rules

### **General Overview**

Record rules allow more granular control over what records users can see or modify. These rules are applied dynamically at the model level and provide flexibility to tailor access based on specific conditions.

---

### **Overriding Record Rules**

Overriding record rules involves modifying or adding rules to meet specific business needs. When doing so:

- Ensure that custom rules don‚Äôt unintentionally open security gaps.
- Always test thoroughly, especially in multi-user environments, to avoid unexpected behavior.

---

### **Scenarios for Overriding Record Rules**

#### **Scenario 1: Restrict Access to Records by Department**

**Default Rule:**  
By default, employees can only access records in their own department. The rule might look like this:

~~~
<record id="ir_rule_employee_own_department" model="ir.rule">
    <field name="name">Access Own Department</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="hr.model_hr_employee"/>
    <field name="domain_force">[('department_id', '=', user.department_id.id)]</field>
    <field name="groups" eval="[(4, ref('hr.group_hr_user'))]"/>
</record>
~~~

**Override Rule to Expand Access:**  
You want HR managers to access records for **all employees**, not just their department. Here‚Äôs the override:

~~~
<record id="ir_rule_employee_all_departments" model="ir.rule">
    <field name="name">Access All Departments</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="hr.model_hr_employee"/>
    <field name="domain_force">[(1, '=', 1)]</field> <!-- Unrestricted access -->
    <field name="groups" eval="[(4, ref('hr.group_hr_manager'))]"/>
</record>
~~~

---

#### **Scenario 2: Restrict Read Access to Sensitive Records**

**Default Rule:**  
All employees can see all project tasks, regardless of who created them. This is the default behavior:

~~~
<record id="ir_rule_project_task_default" model="ir.rule">
    <field name="name">Access All Tasks</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="project.model_project_task"/>
    <field name="domain_force">[(1, '=', 1)]</field>
    <field name="groups" eval="[(4, ref('project.group_project_user'))]"/>
</record>
~~~

**Override Rule to Restrict Access:**  
You override the rule to limit access to only the tasks assigned to the user:

~~~
<record id="ir_rule_project_task_assigned_only" model="ir.rule">
    <field name="name">Access Assigned Tasks Only</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="project.model_project_task"/>
    <field name="domain_force">[('user_id', '=', user.id)]</field>
    <field name="groups" eval="[(4, ref('project.group_project_user'))]"/>
</record>
~~~

#### **Scenario 3: Override Existed Rule to Restrict Access**

#### **Original Rule (Using `department_id`)**

This rule restricts access to employees based on the user's department. It is defined as follows:

~~~
<record id="module_name.rule_department_access" model="ir.rule">
    <field name="name">Access by Department</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="hr.model_hr_employee"/>
    <field name="domain_force">[('department_id', 'in', user.department_ids.ids)]</field>
    <field name="groups" eval="[(4, ref('module_name.group_a'))]"/>
</record>
~~~

#### **Override Rule (Using `branch_id`)**

We override the rule by using the same `id` (`module_name.rule_department_access`), but enforce access based on `branch_id` instead of `department_id`:

~~~
<record id="module_name.rule_department_access" model="ir.rule">
    <field name="name">Access by Branch</field>
    <field name="domain_force">[('branch_id', 'in', user.department_ids.ids)]</field>
    <field name="groups" eval="[(4, ref('module_name.group_a'))]"/>
</record>
~~~

## üë• Groups

**General Overview:**  
Groups define collections of users with shared access rights. Groups often imply other groups for hierarchical permissions.

### **Implication Logic**
- Group A implies Group B when permissions in Group B are automatically granted to Group A.

~~~
<record id="group_user" model="res.groups">
    <field name="name">User</field>
</record>

<record id="group_manager" model="res.groups">
    <field name="name">Manager</field>
    <field name="implied_ids" eval="[(4, ref('module_name.group_user'))]"/>
</record>
~~~
  
### **When to Use [OR - AND] in Groups**
- **OR**: Combine permissions when any condition can suffice.
- **AND**: Restrict permissions by requiring all conditions to be met.

## ‚ùì Questions

1. **Does visibility depend on the group only or the rules applied to the group?**  
   - No, if a user has a group that matches the menu‚Äôs group, the menu is visible, regardless of the ACL or record rules.

2. **Does combining two rules without `perm_read` show any records?**  
   - No, in this case, all records will be visible.

3. **What is the difference between stored and non-stored fields in record rules?**  
   - **Stored Fields**: Use `sudo` to compute values and bypass access rights.  
   - **Non-Stored Fields**: Evaluate rules dynamically and are subject to access rights (record rules).

---

## üõ° The Power of `sudo`

Using `sudo()` in Odoo bypasses access rights and record rules. It‚Äôs powerful for background operations but must be used cautiously to avoid introducing security vulnerabilities (eg.. it can expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized changes).

---

# üèó How to Build Maintainable System Access Rights?

- Start with **simple ACLs** and incrementally add complexity.
- Use groups to create modular permission sets.
- Combine record rules logically for layered security.
- Test permissions with both **admin** and **non-admin** accounts.
